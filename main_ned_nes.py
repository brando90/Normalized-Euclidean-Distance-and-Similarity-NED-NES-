    Normalized eucledian distance in pytorch.

    Cases:
        1. For comparison of two vecs directly make sure vecs are of size [B] e.g. when using nes as a loss function.
            in this case each number is not considered a representation but a number and B is the entire vector to
            compare x1 and x2.
        2. For comparison of two batch of representation of size 1D (e.g. scores) make sure it's of shape [B, 1].
            In this case each number *is* the representation of the example. Thus a collection of reps
            [B, 1] is mapped to a rep of the same size [B, 1]. Note usually D does decrease since reps are not of size 1
            (see case 3)
        3. For the rest specify the dimension. Common use case [B, D] -> [B, 1] for comparing two set of
            activations of size D. In the case when D=1 then we have [B, 1] -> [B, 1]. If you meant x1, x2 [D, 1] to be
            two vectors of size D to be compare feed them with shape [D].
